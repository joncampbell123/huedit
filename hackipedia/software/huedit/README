Hackipedia unicode text editor.
For editing and typing up the unicode UTF-8 documents
involved in Hackipedia, on any platform (that I can
get this to compile and run on).

The user interface is designed for most typical keyboards with function keys
and western keyboards. If provided by the OS (and ncurses) the program will
also respond to the mouse.

The textual look and feel is loosely based on QEdit, an old MS-DOS text editor
I was quite fond of in the early to mid 1990's.
