<b>Introduction [0:00]</b>
Blog Talk Radio!
[introductory music]
Ghost: Hahahahahahahahahaa!
Announcer: This is True Capitalist Radio! [radio echo]
Ghost: <a href="#i am your host the man they call ghost">I am your host, the man they call ghost</a>.
Announcer: The bad-ass of business! Give him capitalism or give him death!
Ghost: That's it. Period.
Announcer: Broadcasting from his skylight office studios in beautiful downtown Austin, Texas.
Ghost: You sound fruitier than a box of <a href="#fruit loops">Fruit Loops</a> for Christ's sake.
Announcer: And now, he'll take it from here! Your host, the prognosticator or prognosticators, the man they call... Ghost!

<b>Start [0:53]</b>
Ghost: What's goin' on folks. Ha-ha! Thank you for tuning in with me, to another edition of True Capitalist Radio. And of course,
       <a href="#i am your host the man they call ghost">I am your host, the man they call Ghost</a>, and once again folks I want to thank you for tunin' in to me. This is episode #123,
       a-hundred and twenty three for folks that are keepin' track of the True Capitalist broadcast. And once again folks, before
       we get into anything, I would like everybody to <i>please</i> re-tweet the broadcast. Go to the social networks, go to the
       forums, go to the blogs, SPREAD IT AROUND BABY! SPREAD IT AROUND LIKE WILDFIRE! And let everybody know that True Capitalist
       Radio is in effect and in the house. Once again I want to thank everybody for tunin' in, I see we gotta lot of people in 
       the chat room with the, you know, bunch of strange weird-ass names. It's obvious that uh, we're going to continue to get
       a bunch of liberal feminist and uh, gay lesbian homosexual agitators that are going to attempt to uh, I dunno deviate the
       show into some kind of circus uh, half-witted sideshow. Uh, but lemme tell you something that is not gonna stop the
       capitalist commentary that I conduct at the beginning of the broadcast and we're gonna start that... RIGHT NOW!

       Let's go ahead and get through the markets because I don't know about you folks but I've been making some god damn money.
       Ha ha ha ha haaa! I don't know about you folks, but I've been makin' some damn money out here and you can look back in the
       archives three weeks back when Dow Jones &amp; Industrials was down about 11,800 points. THE PROGNOSTICATOR OF PROGNOSTICATORS,
       STRIKES AGAIN! Lo and behold, what--you know, where are we at now for Christ's sake, where are we at? 12,719.50 points. And let
       me tell ya, back then while everybody was running out of the equities market, your's truly was going in and bottom-feeding baby!
       I was bottom-feeding, while everybody was like: (mockingly) "Oh I--I think I need to sell my equities I don't know I think
       we're going into a de---(bleating)MAAA NAAA NAAAAAAA".

<b>[3:16]</b>

       And of course folks, those of you who have been listening to me for a long period of time, you know as well as I going back
       January and February, I was talking about this particular little economic retraction since the beginning! If you had been
       listening to this broadcast you would be makin' some serious money right now. If not, you'd be probably sittin' there, you
       know, countin' the bacon bits that you're taking out of your <a href="#shit funnel">shit funnel</a> because unfortunately you don't know your ass
       from your elbow.
